    <p>
      It is a pleasure to have you here to explore recipes from around the
      globe; we welcome your uniqueness and hope you will add dishes of your own
      that you would like to see others prepare to perfection based on your
      specific mixing, heating and blending patterns. <br /> This application
      was created by four full-stack developers who attended Columbia
      Engineering together in NYC. Our backgrounds span the globe and each
      foodie in our group was perplexed by one particular cooking issue. We have
      specific dishes that we wanted others to make, yet these other people
      would fall short consistently. We knew we had to do something to save the
      integrety of our personalized dishes, and we wanted to see people succeed
      in recreating our masterpieces! In an effort to help our friends recreate
      our traditional cuisines without compromising on taste and quality, we
      decided to come together and build a recipe helper that can
      algorithmically time the user and creator down to the second to aid them
      along in all steps of the instructional and recreation process. As such,
      we titled this <strong> The algoDish</strong>, which in future development
      will run entirely on Machine Learning algorithms to help even the least
      cooking inclined person create a tasty dish. <br /> We're excited to have
      you here, and as we are a work in progress towards perfection, we would
      love to hear feedback on your experience as you explore the site and share
      dishes that speak to your soul. As long as you have access to a stove and
      ingredients, the algoDish can suit you. We pride ourselves on creating a
      seamless transition between the inception of the cooking project down to
      the finale of enjoyably eating your creation. <br />
      Algorithms can help us improve in a number of areas, so why not with food?
      <strong>Proven, tried, and true, AlgoDish is here for you.</strong>
